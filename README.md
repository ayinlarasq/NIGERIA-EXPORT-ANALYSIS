# NIGERIA-EXPORT-ANALYSIS
This project aims to analyze Nigeria's agricultural export growth between  2020 and 2023, using data visualization and performance metrics to identify  trends, opportunities, and challenges.

Nigeria's economy has long been reliant on petroleum exports, which has made the country vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices. However, in recent years, agriculture has emerged as a promising sector for economic growth and diversification
Our dataset included information on the type of crop, export 
destination, revenue, and profit. 
We defined our key performance indicators (KPIs) as:
1. Average revenue
2. Total profit
3. Total revenue
4. Total quantity of crops sold
